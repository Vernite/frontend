Continuos integration was resolved using tool named [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

This action after every push to the master branch rebuild the application and deploy it to the production environment using `rsync protocol`.
This action also build documentation page, publishes it and runs tests. There is also included a small script to create badges to use them in `Readme.md` and documentation files.
